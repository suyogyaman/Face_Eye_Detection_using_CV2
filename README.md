# Face_Eye_Detection_using_CV2
Using computer vision, we detect the face and eyes of a person in a still image with HAAR cascade method.

Download the HAAR cascade from this github repo : https://github.com/anaustinbeing/haar-cascade-files
Also create a folder image_examples to add the image for testing our code.
